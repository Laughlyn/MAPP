  m_Text: "BoxBlasters VS\r\nA long time ago, in a galaxy\u2026 some distance away,
    there was war,\r\nbloodshed and sorrow. But then the United Peace council was
    formed\r\nby those who had grown weary of burying loved ones.\r\nThe council banned
    firearms and laser cannons, missiles and\r\nblasters, almost every weapon that
    could be used to harm another\r\nbeing was banned and everyone rejoiced. This
    ban was to be known as\r\nthe United peace accords. There was peace among the
    colonies and\r\ntrade prospered, but on one planet, conflict was brewing\u2026\r\nThe
    planet Boxatron had long been a place where proud warrior clans\r\nwaged war against
    one another, with the two most antagonistic clans\r\nbeing clan McChest with their
    red banner symbolizing power and\r\nstrength, and clan Cart\xF3n with their blue
    banner symbolizing\r\nconservatism and order.\r\nThese two warring clans had,
    since the United peace accords, been in\r\na mutually beneficial peace agreement
    with arranged marriages and\r\ntrade alliances holding it up. But one day, the
    eldest son of house\r\nMcChest, Case McChest, refused to marry the eldest daughter
    of house\r\nCart\xF3n, Cofferina Cart\xF3n. This sparked the beginning of civil
    war,\r\nbut with firearms and laser cannons, missiles and blasters, and\r\nalmost
    every other weapon banned and extinct, how would they fight\r\ntheir war?\r\nTo
    be able to fight their war without interference from the United\r\npeace council
    they decided that battle should take place in space,\r\nand that the only way
    to defeat your enemy was to fire pulse cannons\r\non boxes that where for some
    reason lined up in a row between them.\r\nThis was the only way to solve the conflict.
    THE ONLY WAY\u2026"
